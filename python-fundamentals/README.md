# Python Fundamentals

## Part 01 - Human Resources 1 - make_name_tags

<div align="left">

For each of these challenges, be sure to use an appropriate list method and demonstrate your understanding of TDD.

The functions in this section should be pure, so you should also aim to implement test cases to check the functions have no side effects, besides any other functionality.

You have been tasked with making name tags to be worn by guests at an upcoming company meeting. You have the data for the guests who have been invited, and you will need to add some information on what their name tags should read.

Given a list of guest objects containing title, forename, surname and company keys, your make_name_tags function should return a list containing objects with an additional key, name_tag, the value of which is a string consisting of the title, forename, surname and company.

## Part 02 - Human Resources 2 - create_poll

<div align="left">
Given a list of strings, please build a much more useful poll dictionary.
</div>

## Part 03 - OOP Vending Machine 1

<div align="left">
Complete a credit_checker method and add_stock method
</div>

## Part 04 - OOP Vending Machine 2

<div align="left">
Create a purchase_item method that will decrease the quantity of the stock if there is sufficient credit and return the stock name.
</div>

## Part 05 - Higher-Order Functions and Closures - generate_multiples

<div align="left">
Write a higher-order function called generate_multiples.

The generate_multiples function should:
- Take a number (representing a multiple) as an argument.
- Return a new function.

The new function should:
- Take a number to determine how long the list of multiples should be.
- Return a list of multiples.
</div>
